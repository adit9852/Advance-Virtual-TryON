# Advanced Virtual Try-On Technology

## **Overview**
A high-resolution 2D virtual try-on system built using **HR-VITON**, **PoseNet**, **PyTorch**, and more. This project provides an efficient pipeline for garment segmentation, pose estimation, and garment overlay to enable realistic virtual try-on experiences.

## **Key Features**
- **Garment Segmentation**: Custom binary masks for accurate garment extraction under varying textures and lighting.
- **Pose Estimation**: Implemented **PoseNet** for precise keypoint detection and pose alignment.
- **High-Resolution Try-On**: Used **HR-VITON** to generate 1024x768 try-on outputs.
- **Modular Design**: Scripts for segmentation, dense pose mapping, and garment alignment integrated into a seamless workflow.
