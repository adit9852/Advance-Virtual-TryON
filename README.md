Advanced Virtual Try-On Technology
Overview
A high-resolution 2D virtual try-on system built using HR-VITON, PoseNet, PyTorch, and more. This project provides an efficient pipeline for garment segmentation, pose estimation, and garment overlay to enable realistic virtual try-on experiences.

Model Showcase
(Add images or examples of your try-on results here, e.g., side-by-side comparisons of original images and try-on outputs.)

Key Features
Garment Segmentation: Custom binary masks for accurate garment extraction under varying textures and lighting.
Pose Estimation: Implemented PoseNet for precise keypoint detection and pose alignment.
High-Resolution Try-On: Used HR-VITON to generate 1024x768 try-on outputs.
Modular Design: Scripts for segmentation, dense pose mapping, and garment alignment integrated into a seamless workflow.
Technologies Used
HR-VITON: Deep learning-based virtual try-on model.
